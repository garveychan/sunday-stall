##### The Marketplace Problem

I believe that the long tail market for local value-added goods is underserved - e.g. hobbyist bakers, artisans, creators.

##### Why the problem needs to be solved?

- Fragmented market with uncoordinated micro to medium-sized merchants.
- Discovery is difficult on mature platforms whose algorithms favour established business entities.
