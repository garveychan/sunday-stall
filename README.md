### The Market Problem (R7)

I believe that the long tail market for local value-added goods is underserved - e.g. hobbyist bakers, artisans, creators.

### Why is it a Problem that needs solving? (R8)

- Fragmented market with uncoordinated micro to medium-sized merchants.
- Discovery is difficult on mature platforms whose algorithms favour established business entities.
